1. Write a program with the following structure
1.1 Class -> Calc
1.2 Method -> add
1.3 Method -> sub
1.4 Method -> mul
1.5 Method -> div
Receive two parameter for processing in each method and display the result.


2. Write a program with the following structure
2.1 Class -> Calc
2.2 Constructor which will assign the value for 2 variable a and b
2.3 Method -> add
2.4 Method -> sub
2.5 Method -> mul
2.6 Method -> div
Consider the instance variable for processing in each method and display the result.


3. Write a program with the following structure
3.1 Class -> Calc
3.2 Two variable a,b should be declared as static
3.3 Static Method -> 'set' (which will assign the value for 2 variable a and b)
3.4 Static Method -> add
3.5 Static Method -> sub
3.6 Static Method -> mul
3.7 Static Method -> div
Consider the Static variable for processing in each method and display the result. 
Call all the methods with out creating object for the class. (As all are static)
